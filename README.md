**Privacy Policy**

RandomAppsInc is a Google Play Developer handle primarily operated by Alex Chiou, which provides free, ad-free, and open-source Android apps.

This page is used to inform app users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our services.

**Information Collection and Use**

For some of our apps to function, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your name, phone number, and contacts information. **We never collect or store any of your personal information; we only ask for permissions in order for our apps to function.** None of our apps which ask for these permissions even have access to the internet; you can always verify the veracity of this statement by reading the source code of our apps, which is all publicly available on this GitHub account.
